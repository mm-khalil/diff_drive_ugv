# OBSTACLE  AVOIDANCE  UGV

Code of a self assembled differential drive UGV powered by Arduino


## STEP 1
### COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
    • 2WD Robot kit.
    • Arduino UNO.
    • H-Bridge.
    • Battery.
    • Ultrasonic Sensors.
    • Connecting Wires.

## STEP 2
### ASSEMBLY:
    • First of all we need to Assemble our UGV kit (in our case it is 2WD mobile robot).
    • Here is a youtube link to assemble that specific kit:

## STEP 3
### H-BRIDGE AND MOTOR CONNECTIONS:
    • As we use L298N H-Bridge which drives 2 motors, its input must have 12V and we also take 5V of output from it.
    • For 1 motor we need 3 connections:
    • 2 for motor direction(CW, CCW) = Input (In1 and In2).
    • 1 for enable that motor = Enable Pin (En).                      
    • Here is a youtube link for H-Bridge Connections with motors and Arduino UNO:

## STEP 4
### ULTRASONIC SENSOR  INSTALLATION:
    • For obstacle avoidance we use 2 Ultrasonic sensors.
    • Complete description and installation see this video:
